Project Description: We will look at a dataset containing information about billionaires from different countries and backgrounds to gather information about the appearance of billionaires in different countries, their relative ages, and industries as it relates to their source of income and gender. In answering these questions, we gain a deeper understanding of a small subset of the population that exercise an inordinate amount of influence on the world through their business.  

 

Methodology: We will use python and jupyter notebook for this project.  

 

Notes: We used a dataset found on Kaggle to examine billionaires. This is not a complete list of all billionaires in the world. This dataset also does not clarify how the creators determined whether a billionaire was self made or not, however we have chosen to accept the limitations of the data and work with that we can. We also used a second dataset examining billionaires by country.

Data cleaning and manipulation: This dataset did not require much cleaning nor manipulation.  

 

Questions and Observed Answers:  

 

What industries produce the most billionaires?  

 

As we can see from the below chart, Finance and Investment industries produce the most billionaires with manufacturing and technology coming in second and third.

California and New York are popular states for billionaires to reside in.

How old are these billionaires?

Most of these billionaires were born between 1960 and 1965, making them 58 to 63 years in age.  

  

 

How many billionaires are self made?

Summary  

 

 

The purpose of this project was to gain a deeper insight into billionaires, and to do so we used two datasets examining billionaires. Our first dataset from Kaggle, examined 2640 billionaires in terms of (industry), age, country, city, source, industries, country of citizenship, organization, self made, status, gender, birth date, title, state, residence state region, birth year, birthday day, cpi country, cpi change country, gross tertiary education enrollment, gross primary education enrollment country, life expectancy country, tax revenue, total tax rate country, population country, latitude country, longitude country. While analyzing this data we examined our own held biases about billionaires. In popular culture most of the group associated billionaires, we are used to seeing billionaires related to the tech industry especially social media. However when looking at the pie chart we created, finance and investment is the industry that produces the most billionaires with technology being a close second. Pie charts were also used to break this data down further along gender lines. 14.9% of all male billionaires from this dataset are from the finance and investment industry, with manufacturing and technology once again coming in second and third. The majority of all women billionaires, 13.4%, are from the food and beverages industry with manufacturing being the next highest producer of women billionaires.

The second dataset was used to examine the link between billionaires and their location. A pie chart shows that most of the billionaires in this particular dataset are in the United States, with China and India taking second and third place. This conclusion invites us to take a closer look at the economic policies of the United States, China, and India to find what makes it easier for billionaires to exist in these three countries. We can hypothesize that the large populations of each country as well as their reputation for being economic powerhouses make it easier for people to achieve billionaire status. There is also a possibility that these same factors have created economic disparity which may contribute to the rise of billionaires.  

 

We examined billionaires in terms of states within the United States well. The most popular states for billionaires are California, New York, Florida, Texas, Illinois, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Georgia, and Connecticut. Predictably California and New York were more likely to have billionaires than other states as their reputations of being centers of trade and economics would suggest.

A histogram was used to examine the age of the billionaires in the first dataset. We find that the majority of billionaires are in their late 50s or early 60s. When looking at the age range, we can infer that billionaires that are born in the year 2005 are not self-made billionaires who have had the time to establish themselves and their organizations. The older billionaires would have more of a variety when it comes to self-made or not self made, as they have been able to spend decades of their adult lives establishing themselves in their prospective industries and organizations.

Our final analysis looked at self made billionaires from the Kaggle dataset. It is important to note that we do not know how the creators of this dataset defined self made billionaire. Some may argue that self made billionaires is an inherently contradictory term based on the massive amounts of manpower needed to create such wealth, however, for the purposes of this project we have chosen to not define self made and take this at face value. The amount of self made billionaires far outweighs not self made billionaires. We can see a further divide as we examine this question along gender lines.  

   ![Male Self Made](https://github.com/matvio16/billionaires/assets/141645475/b524d880-68bf-40c5-92ea-01d23f278582)

We can see that men are more likely to be self made billionaires than not self made, while women are more likely to be not self made billionaires than self made. There could be a variety of different factors explaining this such as gender discrimination that makes it harder for women to achieve success in the workplace, leading to inherited wealth being a more likely option, however given our datasets we have no way of knowing.
